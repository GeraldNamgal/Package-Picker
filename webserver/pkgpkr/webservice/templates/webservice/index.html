        Modern applications rely heavily on OSS packages. So how do you find
        good ones? Search engines only know what you tell them, and humans
        can't keep track of the millions of OSS packages available.

        Our approach is to instead look at the dependencies in your
        application. We feed these to a machine learning algorithm, which
        recommends packages that are tailored to your specific application.

        Good packages play nicely with the packages you already use.

        Good packages don't duplicate functionality in other packages.

        Good packages are often the ones your company already uses.
