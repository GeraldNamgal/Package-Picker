                  <p>Modern applications rely heavily on OSS packages. So how do you find
                    good ones? Search engines only know what you tell them, and humans
                    can't keep track of the millions of OSS packages available.</p>
                  <p>Our approach is to instead look at the dependencies in your
                    application. We feed these to a machine learning algorithm, which
                    recommends packages that are tailored to your specific application.</p>
